# Local AI Chat Server

> **Note:**  
> If you want your Flask app to only listen on `localhost`, change the host parameter from `'0.0.0.0'` to `'127.0.0.1'` in `main.py`.This project was created with the help of an AI assistant and will be my *first and last* project I ever make. Although I tried to make it as usable as possible, you might encounter some bugs â€” such as streamed regenerated text not being saved properly. 
It uses Chat Completions-style JSON template, (Similar to open ai's. From my testings Chatml and gemma3 works fine )
## Features

- **Character Management:** Create, update, and delete character profiles with names, descriptions, and avatar URLs.
- **Chat Sessions:** Engage in conversations with characters, saving the chat history.
- **Streaming Responses:** Receive AI responses in real-time as they are generated (using streaming).
- **Cross-Platform:** Designed to run on Windows and mobile devices.

## Prerequisites

1. A working LLM on your PC: You must have an LLM running locally (e.g., LM Studio, Koboldcpp, TextGenWebUI) on port 1234 (default for LM Studio). You can change this port in `main.py`.
2. **Python:** Python 3.10 worked on my machine; it should work with higher versions as well.

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sapphirana/LocalAIChat.git
   ```

2. **Run `Install.bat`**  
   This will install dependencies and start the server automatically.

3. **Configuration (Important):**  
   Make sure that the `LM_STUDIO_API_URL` variable in `main.py` is correctly set to your running LM Studio instance's URL. The default value is:
   ```
   http://localhost:1234/v1/chat/completions
   ```
   Double-check this setting before proceeding.

## Running the Server

1. **Start Your Preferred LLM Engine** (e.g., LM Studio, Koboldcpp, etc.)

2. **Access the Web UI:**  
   Open your web browser and navigate to:  
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5500
   ```
